Project Description :
This project involves building a Movie Trailer Website where users can see their favorite movies trailers. 
It stores a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs at the Server-side. The data can then be expressed on the web page and allow users to watch the trailers. 

How to get Started ?
Run the file ‘entertainment_center.py’ from the python shell. This generates a file which takes in the list of movies and generates an HTML file producing a website.
The other way is to open the fresh_tomatoes.html file from the folder.

How to add your favorite movie ?
In the ‘entertainment_center.py’ file make objects of your favorite movies with self title storyline poster and the link of its trailer as arguments.
Next, save and run your file using Python shell.
